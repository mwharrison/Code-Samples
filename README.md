A loosely organized repo of some code I wrote from about 2012-2014. Here's what's in here:

1. eleanor.py: This is a script that I have running on a RasberryPi in my house. It wakes me up in the morning, tells me what appointments I have (leveraging the Google Calendar API), tells me temperatures on each floor (leveraging the unofficial Nest API), and plays Jurrasic Park music when something ominous is about to happen.

2. zillow.py: A small sample of a project I am working on for consumer level rental property management. This is the function that grabs the data from the API. I use Ajax to load the data onto the frontend.

3. coi_model.py: This is one of the more complex models I have written for an application at Rice. The application is for tracking conflict of interests between research faculty and any gifts/income they receive.

4. bitcoin.m: This is the app delegate from my Bitcoin app (Objective-C). It's pretty crude, but it gets the job done. It was pretty challenging to aritecture something that used so many API's with a more elegant structure. I'm also not really familiar with Objective_C.
